  <h1>About the class</h1>
The Formulas and Vehicles class is given for the first time in the fall semester 2018/2019. It is a project based class to teach basics of autonomous driving. The students will implement their own project ideas on an autonomous race car.
  
The autonomous race car is built on a 1:10 chassis. Calculations are performed on a Raspberry Pi. Currently, available sensor data is obtained from the Raspberry Pi camera and an IMU.
