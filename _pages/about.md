  <h1>About HippoCampus - TEST!!</h1>
The HippoCampus is a micro underwater robot for research and hobby applications.
The quad-rotor design makes HippoCampus agile and allows for complex maneuvers. 
HippoCampus is built with off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts.
It was developed for research in the area of autonomous exploration and monitoring of confined environments.
The first prototype can be traced back to a project carried out by Axel Hackbarth and Eugen Solowjow in December 2014.
In Spring 2016 Tobias Johannink redesigned the HippoCampus as part of his Bachelor thesis.

  <h1>HippoCampus Design</h1>
  The mechanical components of HippoCampus protect the electronics and consist of acrylic tubes and a base unit.
  The on-board electronics include ESCs, brushless DC motors, a LiPo battery, antennas, and system boards.
  The HippoCampus platform uses the <a href="https://pixhawk.org/modules/pixhawk" target="_blank">Pixhawk</a> board as well as a Raspberry Pi 0.
  Firmware design is derived from the <a href="https://github.com/PX4/Firmware" target="_blank">PX4 project</a>. 
  The HippoC stack allows for remote controlled and autonomous operations.
  The HippoC control architecture includes state estimators and controllers for different purposes.
